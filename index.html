                <h1>Welcome!</h1>

                <p>This website is made by fans and is soley dedicated to the fans of the Call of Duty Zombies series. Whether you enjoy playing Infinity Ward, Sledge Hammer, or Treyarch Zombie maps (except for Transit of course), we have it all. The purpose this website provides is as a hub for everything you might be interested in, relating to Zombies content. New to COD Zombies and need to learn the basics? Need to remember those pesky shield part locations that you forgot about? First time attempting the Origins Main Easter Egg? Or writing a novel about the complex story universes? We have you covered. All the ins and outs, a to zs, simple to complicated will be covered here. There's no longer a need to stress over making your own guides that include thirteen different symbol pictures, information from 5 different websites, and in game references from 3 different YouTube guides. Everything you need to know about the Zombies Universe now at the touch of your fingers.</p>

                <h1>The Basics</h1>

                <p>Call Of Duty Zombies is an action first-person shooter that is round based. Which means that as you kill more zombies, rounds will progress and it will get more difficult as zombies increase in spawnrate, health, and speed. In every game that you start, you'll spawn into a starting room. This room can range in size, features, and layout, but the only thing you need to worry about is killing some zombies for points. Even though your first weapon can vary depending on achievements and game, I can assure you that you'll start with something that can kill zombies. One of the main goals for a game of Zombies is surviving for as long as possible. To do this you'll need to get better equipment. As your weapons become less efficient in killing, you'll have to buy new ones. Commonly, you can do this by either buying one from a wall buy or from the Mystery Box, or from upgrading the gun in the Pack-A-Punch machine. Another mechanic that helps the player survive are perks. These are various "power ups" that you can buy that are permanent until you "go down". If you need a breather to explore or collect your thoughts, a main way to stop the hordes from spawning is leaving a "last zombie". The last zombie is the last zombie that spawns at the end of a round. By keeping this zombie alive, no more zombies can spawn because each round has a specific number of zombies that spawn. Lastly, when the zombies hit you enough repeatedly, you will go into a last stance type of state also known as "going down". You can avoid this by running away from a zombie if it hits you, since you regenerate health naturally. Without any special perks, to get revived or "picked back up" you will need another player to come over to you and hold the use button (X on xbox, square on playstation, or E on PC).</p>

                    <h1>Common Features</h1>

                    <h2>Doors:</h2>

                    <img src="images/door.png">

                    <p>The basic progession within a Zombies map from one room to another is through the purchases of doors/barricades. As players kill zombies they can earn the points need to buy these doors and progress through the map.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div id="welcomesection">
                    <h2>Barriers:</h2>

                    <img src="images/barrier.jpeg">

                    <p>Barriers are the things in zombies mode that prevents the Zombies from coming in for a short amount of time. They are located in almost every single room. Barriers can be all sorts of different things. From wooden planks to metal bars, or sometimes just glass or a regular wall. The first type of Barriers were wooden planks. The Zombies would slowly stumble up to them and take them down... One at a time. Of course, if there were more Zombies, the Barriers would be taken down faster. The player can easily repair these barriers by holding the action button for a nice profit of 10 points per board.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="welcomesection">
                    <h2>Wall Buys:</h2>

                    <img src="images/wallbuys.png">

                    <p>Wall Weapons are guns in a Call of Duty map that can be bought through a chalk drawing/outline of a gun on the wall. The cost of a wall weapon will vary depending on its effectiveness, buying ammo will cost half of what you bought the weapon for. These guns are extremely necessary for starting off a game as the only other way of obtaining a gun is from the Mystery Box which can be hard to find and unreliable.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="welcomesection">
                    <h2>The Mystery Box:</h2>

                    <img src="images/mysterybox.jpeg">

                    <p>The Mystery Box (also known as just the Box) is a random weapon generator. The Mystery Box is typically a wooden box with two flashing golden question marks. Buying a weapon will cost various amounts of points depending on the game, but typically costs 950 points. When you press the action button, the available weapons will loop until one randomly selected weapon will stop. This process takes about four-five seconds. If the weapon isn't picked up within a certain amount of time, the gun will sink back into the box and will be gone until it's randomly rolled again. Many people prefer to buy their weapons here because it is the only place to get powerful weapons such as most wonder weapons.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="welcomesection">
                    <h2>Wonder Weapons:</h2>

                    <img src="images/raygun.jpeg">

                    <p>Wonder Weapons are a series of powerful and unusual weapons that are either built, found, or pulled from the mystery box. The first and most famous wonder weapon in Zombies history is the Ray Gun. Each Wonder Weapon has a unique function that separates it from the rest of the available weapons. The unique abilities vary from weapon to weapon but are generally devastating to the zombies in the later rounds, helping the player's chance of survival. Most of the time, wonder weapons also greatly assist in killing boss zombies.</p>

                <div id="welcomesection">
                    <h2>Pack-a-Punch:</h2>

                    <img src="images/packapunch.jpeg">

                    <p>The Pack-a-Punch Machine allows weapons to be upgraded to better versions of themselves. The machine typically changes the weapon's name, adds one or more attachments, increases the damage output, increases the magazine capacity and makes the firing sound higher pitched accompanied by a red/purple muzzle flash. The weapon also notably gains a bizarre camouflage to accent the changes done to it. The camouflage changes by game and typically by map as well.</p>
